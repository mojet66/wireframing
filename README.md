# Wireframing
## What is Wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key Element found in the wireframe
1. Layout Structure: it defines the placement of headers, footers, side bars and content blocks. e.g a 12-column grid system for reponsive design ensures content adapts seamlessly across device.
2. Navigation: this  guides the users through the interface, including menus, bottuns, links and breadcrumbs. e.g a sticky header with a hamburger menu (for mobile) and dropdowns (for desktop) ensure easy access to pages without overwhelming users.
3. Content Placement: this is the strategic positioning of texts, images, videos and CTAs to prioritize user attention. It creates a visual hierarchy, directs user flow and improve engagement.
4. Functionanlity: they are interactive element like forms, search bars, filters or modals that enable user actions. It clarifies requirements early, ensuring features like search filters or login forms work seamlessly, improving usability and reducing development errors.
